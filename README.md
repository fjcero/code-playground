# Random Code Samples

Some of the next samples were to learn, others as coding interviews, but in general show some of the patterns I apply in diferent projects. Probably not all of them are well implemented since are not real Side Projects or production ready.

- [Blog](/fjcero/random-code-samples/tree/angular/blog): handle posts page and allow users to insert new comments to a thread. It uses `json-serve` as backend and Angular as fronted.
- [Infinite Scroll Pagination](/fjcero/random-code-samples/tree/angular/pagination): focus on generate a list of items and add a Ad every N items, avoiding to have 2 contiguous Ads in the same column and triggering Scroll before reach end of page.
